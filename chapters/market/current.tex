There are current applications that have the same principle as ours using an android application and a web application to automate the management process, however these applications are not Egyptian. Companies that want to use them has to pay monthly fees for the basic set of features. Follows are the two most applications that mimic the FSM functionality.

\subsection{Jobber}

	Jobber is an Octopusapp Inc. product, a company that is located in Canada. It has a mobile application with the basic set of features at 59\$ per month and a 9\$ per employee for some features that they consider advanced, like upload notes and attachments to allow technician to upload some notes with the task, a feature that is fully implemented in FSM with no extra fees.
\subsection{Field Aware}

	Field Aware uses a mobile application and a web application however their android mobile application is still in the testing phase where a lot of features are missing and still being implemented.

\subsection{Other Products}
	There are products under the category of CRM\footnote{Customer Relationship Management} and EPR\footnote{Enterprise Resource Planning} that serves a similar purpose as our application but not in one encapsulated application but distributed functionality across different applications integrated together, and they lack some crucial features such as route optimization and technicians tracking.
	\subsubsection{Sales Force}
		The Salesforce app has capabilities that include, sales management, marketing automation, partner relationship management and customer service. These help organizations manage customer accounts, track sales leads, conduct and monitor marketing campaigns and provide service post sale.
		
		As we can see it's more market oriented than after sale oriented and it's only available as SaaS.\footnote{Software-as-a-Service}
