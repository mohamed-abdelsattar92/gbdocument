``Time is money'' \footnote{The phrase is usually credited to Benjamin Franklin, who used it in an essay \textit{(Advice to a Young Tradesman, 1748).}}, the most important aspect of service companies is good response time, we don't want a broken asset to be fixed with the most perfect quality but after 10 days of reporting the problem, do we ?. 

Usually good response time means a happier customer and a more prosperous business, bad response time almost always anger the customers and raise the probability of losing them to competitors, companies that are'nt up to the challenge face serious problems.

Inventory assets tracking is another issue, many service companies have problems in tracking their spare parts in the inventory and in the field, which spare part is taken by which technician, billing and invoicing using pencil and paper can result in many problems and forgery, hence money loss and unhappy customer.

Pencil and paper can work with tens of customers but once we're dealing with hundreds, thousands or hundreds of thousands of customers we need a better approach to tackle the problems of dispatching, scheduling, routing, inventory assets tracking and technician tracking. That's why Field Service Maestro is the best solution for such companies that have a moderate to semi-large work load.
