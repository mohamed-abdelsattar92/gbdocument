\subsection{Time}
	We had a very time challenging plan throughout the year as it's full of projects, midterms, exams, etc..., and we had to design, implement and test the product in such a small given time with just two persons in the team.
\subsection{Technology}
	Technology was a bit tricky for us because we had to integrate more than one technology (Android, Python, MySQL), we solved this problem by learning about web services where the business logic resides on the server and many interfaces can connect to it. 
\subsection{Information}
	We faced such a hard time getting information from companies, most of the information we got was considered somehow confidential and off the record, so we couldn't use it for our presentation or official documentation we just used them to know that we were on the right track.
