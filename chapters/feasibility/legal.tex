Field Service Maestro uses GPS\footnote{Global Positioning System.} to locate customers addresses and locations of technicians.

Until 2009 GPS was banned in Egypt but under the decision issued by the National Telecommunications Regulation Authority GPS banning was removed and its features in mobile phones can be freely used.\cite{gps_remove_ban}

From the above statements we assure our customers that Field Service Maestro comply to all legal laws and regulations.
