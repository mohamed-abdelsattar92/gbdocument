The main flow of our application is that the customer service user add customers, add devices to these customers, add problems to these devices. Then dispatcher users assign these problems to specific technicians, each technician view his visits after being route optimized by the route optimization module, add tickets solutions, close tickets, assign spare parts to certain tickets, and finally print the bill (in case of hand-held devices).

This main flow has been throughly tested practically and results are validated by observing the database and the GUI.
