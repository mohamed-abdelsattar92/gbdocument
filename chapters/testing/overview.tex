Testing and validation is one of the most important phases in software products development.

Implemented programs should meet certain criteria and agreed upon level of reliability and functionality guarantee, many testing methodologies have been developed to ensure this level.

One example that shows how testing for software is important is that for safety critical software the \href{http://www.faa.gov/}{US Federal Aviation Administration} requires that the software under test passes the logic coverage criteria\cite{software_testing}.

So for our product -that is not safety critical software- we're going to use some of the most common testing methodologies and coverage criteria. We're going to use unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
