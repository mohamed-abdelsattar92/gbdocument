\subsection{Django}
	Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your application without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.
	\subsubsection{Rapid Development}
		\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.25\textwidth}

			\caption{Django Logo}
		\end{wrapfigure}
		Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.
	\subsubsection{Security and Scalability}
		Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes. Also it's highly scalable and can take the web application from being used by a hundred users to thousands of users in a blink of an eye.\cite{django}
		
\subsection{Android Studio}
	Android Studio provides the fastest tools for building applications on every type of Android device. World-class code editing, debugging, performance tooling, a flexible build system, and an instant build/deploy system all allow you to focus on building unique and high quality applications.\cite{android_studio}

	\end{figure}
	\subsubsection{Intelligent Code Editor}
		Write better code, work faster, and be more productive with an intelligent code editor that helps you each step of the way. Android Studio is built on IntelliJ and is capable of advanced code completion, refactoring, and code analysis.
	\subsubsection{Fast and Feature-Rich Emulator}
		Install and run your applications faster than with a physical device and test your application on virtually any Android device configuration: Android phones, Android tablets, Android Wear, and Android TV devices.
	\subsubsection{Robust and Flexible Build System}
		Easily configure your project to include code libraries and generate multiple build variants from a single project. With Gradle, Android Studio offers high-performance build automation, robust dependency management, and customizable build configurations.
	\subsubsection{Develop For All Android Devices}
		Target multiple form factors with a single project to easily share code among your different versions of your application. Android Studio provides a unified environment to develop applications for Android phones, tablets, Android Wear, Android TV, and Android Auto.
\subsection{Android SDK}
	The Android SDK\footnote{Software Development Kit.} is a set of development tools used to develop applications for Android platform.
	\subsubsection{Android SDK includes the following}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Required libraries.
			\item Debugger.
			\item emulator.
			\item Relevant documentation for the Android application program interfaces (APIs).
		\end{itemize}
\subsection{Atom}
	\href{https://www.atom.io}{Atom} is a text editor that's modern and approachable, tool you can customize to do anything but also use productively without ever touching a configuration file.\cite{atom}
	\begin{figure}[ht]

		\includegraphics[scale = .5]{implementation/atom_logo.jpg}
		\caption{Atom Logo}
	\end{figure}
	\subsubsection{Cross Platform Editing}
		Atom works across operating systems. You can use it on OS X, Windows, or Linux.
	\subsubsection{Smart Autocompletion}
		Atom helps you write code faster with a smart, flexible autocomplete.
	\subsubsection{File System Browser}
		Easily browse and open a single file, a whole project, or multiple projects in one window.
	\subsubsection{Multiple Panes}
		Split your Atom interface into multiple panes to compare and edit code across files.
	\subsubsection{Find and Replace}
		Find, preview, and replace text as you type in a file or across all your projects.
		
\subsection{Git}
	\href{https://git-scm.com/}{Git} is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
		\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.25\textwidth}
			\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{implementation/git_logo.png}
			\caption{Git Logo}
		\end{wrapfigure}
	Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM\footnote{Software Configuration Management} tools like Subversion, CVS\footnote{Concurrent Version Systems}, and Perforce with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple work flows.\cite{git}
	\subsubsection{Branching and Merging}
		The Git feature that really makes it stand apart from nearly every other SCM out there is its branching model. Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other. The creation, merging, and deletion of those lines of development takes seconds.
	\subsubsection{Small and Fast}
		Git is fast. With Git, nearly all operations are performed locally, giving it a huge speed advantage on centralized systems that constantly have to communicate with a server somewhere.
		
		Git was built to work on the Linux kernel, meaning that it has had to effectively handle large repositories from day one. Git is written in C, reducing the overhead of run times associated with higher-level languages. Speed and performance has been a primary design goal of the Git from the start.
	\subsubsection{Staging Area}
			\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.25\textwidth}
				\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{implementation/git_stage.png}
				\caption{Git Staging Area}
			\end{wrapfigure}
		Unlike the other systems, Git has something called the ``staging area'' or ``index''. This is an intermediate area where commits can be formatted and reviewed before completing the commit.
		
		One thing that sets Git apart from other tools is that it's possible to quickly stage some of your files and commit them without committing all of the other modified files in your working directory or having to list them on the command line during the commit.
		
\subsection{Google Maps APIs}
	\href{https://developers.google.com/maps/}{Google Maps} is a Web-based service that provides detailed information about geographical regions and sites around the world. In addition to conventional road maps, Google Maps offers aerial and satellite views of many places. In some cities, Google Maps offers street views comprising photographs taken from vehicles.\cite{google_maps}
	\subsubsection{Features}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A route planner offers directions for drivers, bikers, walkers, and users of public transportation who want to take a trip from one specific location to another.
			\item The Google Maps Application Programmable Interface (API) makes it possible for websites administrators to embed Google Maps into a proprietary site such as a real estate guide or community service page.
			\item Google Maps for mobile offers a location service for motorists that utilizes the Global Positioning System (GPS) location of the mobile device (if available) along with data from wireless and cellular networks.
			\item Google Street View enables users to view and navigate through horizontal and vertical panoramic street level images of various cities around the world.
		\end{itemize}
