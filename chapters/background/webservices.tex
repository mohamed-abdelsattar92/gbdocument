A web service is an API\footnote{Application Programmable Interface.} that shares business logic, data, and processes through a programmatic interface across a network.\cite{webo}. Many interfaces then can be used to consume the web service.

This architecture allows different applications from different environments to communicate together, Java applications can talk to Python applications, Windows applications can communicate and share data with Unix base applications, etc.. 

It also allows code reuse, why doing what's already done?, whey reinvent the wheel?. Web services can offer for example weather reports, currency conversions, or even language translation as a service to be consumed by any application.

\subsubsection{REST-full Web Services}
	Throughout the years SOAP\footnote{Simple Object Access Protocol.} based web services were the most used in enterprise applications, and to some extent they still are because of their ease of use and the fact that they use XML which was already known and adopted by many developers. However the verbosity of SOAP messages make them very unappealing to mobile based communications so a good alternative was needed. This is the area where JSON\footnote{Java Script Object Notation.} REST-full web services shines the best, where they use HTTP\footnote{Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.} and JSON to send and receive messages between communicating parties, which results in less verbosity hence less communication bandwidth.
